    "Tuples are ordered iterable groupings of references to objects, but they are different to lists or dictionaries in a number of important ways. The main difference is that a tuple is \"immutable\" - meaning it cannot be altered once it has been created. Tuples also allow some useful operations and are slightly faster and more memory efficient that lists and dictionaries."

    "\n",
    "* You want to make a reference to variables unchangeable elsewhere in the code\n",
    "* The order of data in your variable has an important meaning\n",
    "* You want to return multiple variables from a function\n",
    "* You want to use a tuple as a key for a dictionary\n",
    "* You don't need to change the stored references and want the extra speed of a tuple\n",
    "\n",
    "Of these, the most important is probably the fact that tuples can return multiple values from a function, but you may want to make use of these other properties at some point.\n",

We decide to store these variables as a tuple for two different points and want to find the vector describing the displacement between them, also as a tuple.
