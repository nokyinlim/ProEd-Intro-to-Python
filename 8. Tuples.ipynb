The main difference is that a tuple is \"immutable\" - meaning it cannot be altered once it has been created. Tuples also allow some useful operations and are slightly faster and more memory efficient that lists and dictionaries."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"LSo-A0ROgJQ_"},"source":["## Syntax\n","Tuples are defined by group variables within parentheses, separated by commas.
