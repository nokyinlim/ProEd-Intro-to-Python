Variable names don't need to be a single character but must not contain a space. There are other restrictions that you'll learn about in a future notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also write:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "var1=var2\n",
    "```\n",
    "which will cause the variable named ```var1``` to become associated with the same information as ```var2```.\n",
    "\n",
    "Code in Python is executed from top to bottom, so you must set a variable using an equals sign before you can use it. For many types of variables, when the name of a variable is written inside a print statement (without quotation marks) the value of that variable will be printed in the output. For example:"
